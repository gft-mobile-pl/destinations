# Destinations: type-safe multi-module navigation

Currently Google suggests using `routes` to specify destinations while navigating in Compose enabled projects. 
Unfortunately `routes` based navigation has many limitations which cannot be easily mitigated and is generally a step back 
when compared to `xml` based navigation.

`Destinations` library aims to deliver a similar set of features as `xml` based solution while avoiding the pitfalls of `routes`.

| Type-safety                                     | ✔ Yes, Compile-time.                                                                                                                    | ❌ No, crash on runtime.                                                                                                    |
| Supported types                                 | ✔ Primitives, Parcelable, Serializable.                                                                                                 | ❌ Primitives only.                                                                                                         |
| Data classes as arguments                       | ✔ Yes (if it is Parcelable or Serializable).                                                                                            | ❌ No.                                                                                                                      |
| Any number of arguments                         | ✔ Yes (multiple arguments must be grouped<br />in a single Parcelable or Serializable).                                                 | ✔ Yes.                                                                                                                     |
| Order of arguments is important                 | ✔ No. You can use named arguments in any order.                                                                                         | ❌ Yes if you use `/slash/{syntax}/`<br/>✔ No if you use `?query={syntax}`.                                                 |
| Arguments description required                  | ✔ No. You define arguments as common Kotlin fields.                                                                                     | ❌ You need to provide a `NamedNavArgument`  for each parameter. Parameter will be typed to `String` otherwise.             |
| Nullable arguments supported                    | ✔ Yes. You simply use nullable field (by adding `?`).                                                                                   | ❌ No if you use `/slash/{syntax}/`<br/>✔ Yes if you use `?query={syntax}`.                                                 |
| Defining conflicting destinations possible      | ✔ No. Identifiers are generated automatically and cannot repeat.                                                                        | ❌ Yes, as `routes` are just `String`-s created manually.                                                                   |
| Encapsulating destination in sub-graph possible | ✔ Yes.                                                                                                                                  | ❌ No. Even if you place a destination in a sub-graph you can navigate to it directly as all `routes` are global.           |
| Controlling destinations visibility possible    | ✔ Yes. You simply control the visibility of `Destination` objects in Kotlin. You can't navigate to a `Destination` without a reference. | ❌ No. You can always navigate to any destination if you know the `String` defining the `route` as all `routes` are global. |
| Deeplinks supported                             | ✔ Not required. You may define a deeplink as usual and redirect it to `Destination` using `Side Effect`.                                | ✔ Yes.                                                                                                                     |
| Annotation processor required                   | ✔ No.                                                                                                                                   | ✔ No.                                                                                                                      |
| Reflection used                                 | ✔ No.                                                                                                                                   | ✔ No.                                                                                                                      |
| Amount of boilerplate                           | ✔ Minimalistic API.                                                                                                                     | ❌ A lot of boilreplate is required to define and use arguments.                                                            |
